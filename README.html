<H1>Introduction to LaFiC</H1>

<p>
LaFiC means <i>layout and format in comments</i>, as all layout and
format information is put into comment lines. So layout and
content are <em>fully</em> separated.
</p>

<H2>Installation</H2>

<p>
Get source from github using:
</p>

<pre>
git clone https://github.com/SebastianMeisel/lafic.git

</pre>

<p>
Add lafic directory to $PATH, e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
export PATH=${PATH}:~/lafic

</pre>

<p>
See <span class="tt">lafic-mode.el</span> for installation instructions, if you want
to use in in Gnu Emacs.
</p>

<H2>Writing text in LaFiC</H2>

<H3>Lines and paragraphs</H3>

<p>
The content is presented in two forms, which also include
the most basic layout: There are <em>lines</em> and <em>paragraphs</em>.
</p>

<p>
The difference is not so much the length, but lines include
none of the punctation marks <em>».«, »?«, »!«, »:«</em>. If no
further layout information is provided, these are
interpreted as headings.
</p>

<p>
The <em>first</em> line is interpreted as <em>the</em> title and presented as
this is as &lt;h1&gt;, when converted to Html, and \title, when 
converted to LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
Further line will be converted to &lt;h3&gt; (Html) or \section
(LaTeX), if no otherwise specified.
</p>

<p>
This way simple Documents Html may be structured with no explicit
layout information at all.
</p>

<H3>Comments</H3>

<p>
You can add comments to your text, by starting a single line
or each <em>line</em> of a paragraph with a % char with no leading
spaces. These lines or paragraphs must, however, be
separated by empty line from the content.
</p>

<pre>
  % This is a comment.

  % This is a longer comment, that spreads over several
  % lines. It is important that it is not connected to a line
  % of the general content.

</pre>

<p>
“It is recommended, however, to start comments with two % chars.
Else there may occur ‘ problems’, when there” is a »:« somewhere
in the comment. You also can start a longer comment this way
and don't need to repeat it ‘ in every’ line.
</p>

<pre>
  %% This is a comment! No mistake!
  Even when you go on with no leading % it's still a comment.

</pre>


<H3>Formated paragraphs</H3>

<p>
Paragraphs can be formated by adding a line before the
paragraph, that starts with a % char, followed by a single
word. There are some predefined keywords, like quote or
quotation for&nbsp;– well a quotation.
</p>

<pre>
  % quote
  This is a quotation.

</pre>

<blockquote>
This is a quotation.

</blockquote>

<p>
If the keyword is unknown, it will be converted to an environment
name in LaTeX or the name of a &lt;div&gt; in Html.
</p>

<H3>Formated lines</H3>

<p>
Line are formated in the same way, only they are converted
to macros (LaTeX) oder &lt;span&gt; names (HTML). Know keywords
are H1&nbsp;… H6 for headings.
</p>

<pre>
  % heading4
  This is a subsection

</pre>

<H4>This is a subsection</H4>

<H3>Inline formation</H3>

<p>
If you want to format words or sequences in a paragraph (or
line if needed), you add format lines with a leading % after
a paragraph. It has two parts:
</p>

<ol>


<li> the word or the sequence to be formated in the form
  start…end. </li>

<li> a keyword.

</li>
</ol>

<p>
The both are separated by a »:«.
</p>

<p>
Known environment keywords are e.g. quote or quotation.
</p>

<p>
If the keyword is unknown, it is converted to a macro
(LaTeX) oder &lt;span&gt; (HTML) name.
</p>

<H3>Images</H3>

<p>
The simplest way to put an image into a LaFiC file is a
line with the image name, with a know extention: png, jpg,
jpeg, gif.
</p>

<pre>
  Image.png
  % height = 40%

</pre>

<img style="height: 40%;" src="/home/sebastian/lafic/Image.png">

<p>
Note that this will not put an figure environment in LaTeX
files, so the image won't float this way. For this to
achieve to have to put % image, %img or %figure before the
line. You don't need the extention then.
</p>

<pre>
  %image
  Image.png
  % width = 40%
  % caption = "Moon and Mars"

</pre>

<figure role="group">
<img style="width: 40%;" src="/home/sebastian/lafic/Image.png">
<figcaption>"Moon and Mars"</figcaption>
</figure>


</body>
</html>
