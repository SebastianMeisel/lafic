<H1>Introduction to LAFIC</H1>

<p>
LAFIC means <em>layout an format</em> in comments, as all layout and
format information is put into comment lines. So layout and$
content are <em>fully</em> separated.
</p>

<H2>Installation</H2>

<p>
Get source from github using:
</p>

<blockquote>
git clone https://github.com/SebastianMeisel/lafic.git

</blockquote>

<p>
Add lafic directory to $PATH, e.g.:
</p>

<blockquote>
export PATH=${PATH}:~/lafic

</blockquote>

<H2>Writing text in LAFIC</H2>

<H3>Lines and paragraphs</H3>

<p>
The content is presented in two forms, which also include
the most basic layout: There are <em>lines</em> and <em>paragraphs</em>.
</p>

<p>
The difference is not so much the length, but lines include
none of the punctation marks ”.”, ”?”, ”!”. If no further layout
information is provided, these are interpreted as headings.
</p>

<p>
The first line is interpreted as the title and presented as
this is as &lt;h1&gt;, when converted to HTML, and \title, when 
converted to LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
Further line will be converted to &lt;h3&gt; (<span class="sc">Html</span>) or \section
(LaTeX), if no otherwise specified.
</p>

<p>
This way simple Documents may be structured with no explicit
layout information at all.
</p>

<H3>Comments</H3>

<p>
You can add comments to your text, by starting a single line
or each line of a paragraph with a % char with no leading
spaces. These lines or paragraphs must, however, be
separated by empty line from the content.
</p>



<p>
It is recommended, however, to start comments with two % chars.
Else there may occur problems, when there is a ”:” somewhere
in the comment. You also can start a longer comment this way
and don“t need to repeat it in every line.
</p>


<H3>Formated paragraphs</H3>

<p>
Paragraphs can be formated by adding a line before the
paragraph, that starts with a % char, followed by a single
word. There are some predefined keywords, like quote or
quotation for&nbsp;– well a quotation.
</p>

<blockquote>
This is a quotation.

</blockquote>

<p>
If the keyword is unknown, it will be converted to an environment
name in LaTeX or the name of a &lt;div&gt; in Html.
</p>

<H3>Formated lines</H3>

<p>
Line are formated in the same way, only they are converted
to macros (LaTeX) oder &lt;span&gt; names (HTML). Know keywords
are H1&nbsp;… H6 for headings.
</p>

<blockquote>
  % H4<br />
  This is a subsection<br />

</blockquote>

<H4>This is a subsection</H4>

<H3>Inline formation</H3>

<p>
If you want to format words or sequences in a paragraph (or
line if needed), you add format lines with a leading % after
a paragraph. It has two parts:
</p>

<ol>


<li> the word or the sequence to be formated in the form
  start…end. </li>

<li> a keyword.

</li>
</ol>

<p>
The both are separated by a ”:”.
</p>

<p>
Known environment keywords are e.g. quote or quotation.
</p>

<p>
If the keyword is unknown, it is converted to a macro
(LaTeX) oder &lt;span&gt; (HTML) name.
</p>

<H3>Images</H3>

<p>
The simplest way to put an image into a LAFIC file is a
line with the image name, with a know extention: png, jpg,
jpeg, gif.
</p>

<img style="height: 40%;" src="/home/sebastian/lafic/Image.png">

<p>
Note that this will not put an figure environment in LaTeX
files, so the image won“t float this way. For this to
achieve to have to put % image, %img or %figure before the
line. You don“t need the extention then.
</p>

<figure role="group">
<img style="width: 40%;" src="/home/sebastian/lafic/Image.png">
<figcaption>"Moon and Mars"</figcaption>
</figure>
