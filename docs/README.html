<H3>Introduction to LaFiC</H3>

<p>
LaFiC means <i>layout and format in comments</i>, as all layout and
format information is put into comment lines. So layout and
content are <em>fully</em> separated. For details see <a href="#Writing">Writing Text in LaFiC</a>.
</p>

<H3>Why LaFiC</H3>

<p>
I've been working with LaTeX / XeLaTeX for many years
now. Mostly I'm writing prose (no math at all). I often
found it disturbing, that I'm forced to create a preamble
instead of just start writing.
</p>

<p>
I started using markdown / multimarkdown. Being quite
inflexible it didn't convince me either. Also I didn't like
the cryptic syntax so much. The LaTeX output was quite
cryptic as well.
</p>

<p>
The I remembered my father saying, he'd like to be able to
just start writing as with his old typewriter only with a
better formating to end with.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least I was thinking a lot about how the layout
and formation of a text could be cleaner separated from the
content.
</p>

<p>
With LaFiC I can start writing without a thought about the
Layout. Still I get a well structured HTML or <a class="fn" href="#fn1" id="fna1">(Xe)LaTeX</a>
document, that I can further render to PDF.
</p>

<p>
When I'm ready with writing, I can start formatation by
adding human readable comments, beeing my own lector.
</p>

<H2>Installation and Usage</H2>

<H3>Prerequisites</H3>

<p>
LaFiC requires Perl &gt; 5.10.1 (tested with Perl 5.26.1).
</p>

<p>
The standard templates require a resent XeLaTeX installation
with a least graphicx, hyperref, microtype and xspace.
</p>

<p>
The Gnu Emacs lisp files where tested with Gnu Emacs 25.2.2.
</p>

<p>
<span class="tt">lafic2pdf</span> also requires latexmk (tested with version 4.41).
</p>

<H3 id="installation">Installation</H3>

<p>
Get source from <a href="https://github.com">github</a> using:
</p>

<pre>
<p>git clone https://github.com/SebastianMeisel/lafic.git</p>
</pre>


<p>
Add lafic directory to $PATH, e.g.:
</p>

<pre>
<p>export PATH=${PATH}:~/lafic</p>
</pre>


<p>
See <span class="tt">lafic-mode.el</span> for installation instructions, if you want
to use in in <a class="fn" href="#fn2" id="fna2">Gnu Emacs</a>.
</p>

<H3>Usage</H3>

<p>
For now the LaFiC distribution consists of three scripts
that you call with the name of the LaFiC file.
</p>

<pre>
<p># lafic2html Datei.lafic
# lafic2tex Datei.lafic
# lafic2pdf Datei.lafic</p>
</pre>


<p>
The last of these is a bash script, first calling <span class="tt">lafic2tex</span>
and then <span class="tt">latexmk</span>.
</p>

<p>
Calling these three script would result in the following
files:
</p>

<pre>
<p>Datei.html
Datei.tex
Datei.pdf</p>
</pre>


<H3>LaFiC major mode in GNU Emacs</H3>

<p>
After installing and activation <span class="tt">lafic-mode.el</span> (see
<a href="#installation">Installation</a>), the LaFiC major mode is activated on opening
any file with a <span class="tt">*.lafic</span> extension.
</p>

<p>
This gives you basic syntax highlighting and some keyboard
shortcuts with a <span class="tt">C-c</span> prefix. The shortcuts are similar to
those used in AUCTeX.
</p>

<H2 id="Writing">Writing text in LaFiC</H2>

<H3>Lines and paragraphs</H3>

<p>
The content is presented in two forms, which also include
the most basic layout: There are <em>lines</em> and <em>paragraphs</em>.
</p>

<p>
The difference is not so much the length, but lines include
none of the punctation marks (., ?, !, :). If no
further layout information is provided, these are
interpreted as headings.
</p>

<p>
The <em>first</em> line is interpreted as <em>the</em> title and presented as
this is as &lt;h1&gt;, when converted to Html, and \title, when 
converted to LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
Further line will be converted to &lt;h3&gt; (Html) or \section
(LaTeX), if no otherwise specified.
</p>

<p>
This way simple Documents may be structured with no explicit
layout information at all.
</p>

<H3>Comments</H3>

<p>
You can add comments to your text, by starting a single line
or each <em>line</em> of a paragraph with a % char with no leading
spaces. These lines or paragraphs must, however, be
separated by empty line from the content.
</p>

<pre>
<p>  % This is a comment.</p>

<p>  % This is a longer comment, that spreads over several
  % lines. It is important that it is not connected to a line
  % of the general content.</p>
</pre>


<p>
“It is recommended, however, to start comments with two % chars.
Else there may occur ‘ problems’, when there” is a »:« somewhere
in the comment. You also can start a longer comment this way
and don't need to repeat it ‘ in every’ line.
</p>

<pre>
<p>  %% This is a comment! No mistake!
  Even when you go on with no leading % it's still a comment.</p>
</pre>



<H3>Formated paragraphs</H3>

<p>
Paragraphs can be formated by adding a line before the
paragraph, that starts with a % char, followed by a single
word. There are some predefined keywords, like quote or
quotation for&nbsp;– well a quotation.
</p>

<pre>
<p>  % quote
  This is a quotation.</p>
</pre>


<blockquote>
<p>This is a quotation.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>
If the keyword is unknown, it will be converted to an environment
name in LaTeX or the name of a &lt;div&gt; in Html.
</p>

<H3>Formated lines</H3>

<p>
Line are formated in the same way, only they are converted
to macros (LaTeX) oder &lt;span&gt; names (HTML). Know keywords
are H1&nbsp;… H6 for headings.
</p>

<pre>
<p>  % heading4
  This is a subsection</p>
</pre>


<H4>This is a subsection</H4>

<H3>Inline formation</H3>

<p>
If you want to format words or sequences in a paragraph (or
line if needed), you add format lines with a leading % after
a paragraph. It has two parts:
</p>

<ol>
<li> the word or the sequence to be formated in the form
  start…end. </li>
<li> a keyword.
</li>
</ol>


<p>
The both are separated by a »:«.
</p>

<p>
Known environment keywords are e.g. quote or quotation.
</p>

<p>
If the keyword is unknown, it is converted to a macro
(LaTeX) oder &lt;span&gt; (HTML) name.
</p>

<H3>Lists</H3>

<p>
Lists are the only things, that need some kind of
markup. You have to start each topic of the list with one of
the following chars:&nbsp;<span class="tt">–, *, +, -</span>. It doesn't matter, which one you
choose. You may indent the lines, but that has no influence
on the layout.
</p>

<pre>
<p>
* Top 1.
- Top 2.</p>
</pre>


<ul>
<li> Top 1.</li>
<li> Top 2.
</li>
</ul>


<p>
For multilevel lists, you have to choises, to raise or
decrease the level: The clean LaFiC style would be,
to start a new paragraph and add the keyword <span class="tt">»% level+«</span>
or <span class="tt">»% level-«</span> at the end.
</p>

<pre>
<p>
  * Top 1.
  * Top 2.</p>

<p>
  * Top 2a.
  * Top 2b.
  % level+</p>
</pre>


<ul>
<li> Top 1.</li>
<li> Top 2.

</li>
<ul>
<li> Top 2a.</li>
<li> Top 2b.
</li>
</ul>

</ul>

<p>
Or you can write the list in one paragraph, marking the
raise or decrease of the level with a &gt; or &lt; at the
beginning of a single line.
</p>

<pre>
<p>
  * Top 1.
  * Top 2.
  >
    * Top 2a.
    * Top 2b.
  <
  * Top 3</p>
</pre>


<ul>
<li> Top 1.</li>
<li> Top 2.
</li>
<ul>
<li> Top 2a.</li>
<li> Top 2b.
</li>
</ul>
<li> Top 3
</li>
</ul>


<H3>Images</H3>

<p>
The simplest way to put an image into a LaFiC file is a
line with the image name, with a know extention: png, jpg,
jpeg, gif.
</p>

<pre>
<p>  Image.png
  % height = 40%</p>
</pre>


<img style="height: 40%;" src="./Image.png">

<p>
Note that this will not put an figure environment in LaTeX
files, so the image won't float this way. For this to
achieve to have to put % image, %img or %figure before the
line. You don't need the extention then.
</p>

<pre>
<p>  %image
  Image.png
  % width = 40%
  % caption = "Moon and Mars"</p>
</pre>


<figure  role="group">
<img style="width: 40%;" src="./Image.png">
<figcaption>"Moon and Mars"</figcaption>
</figure>
<div id="footnotes">
<ol>
<li id="fn1"><a href="#fna1">The standard templates for LaFiC are all based on XeLaTeX to support UTF-8. Still using LaTeX should be possible.</a>
</li>
<li id="fn2"><a href="#fna2">GNU Emacs is available as free Software under a GNU General Public License for most modern operating systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, macOS und Windows).</a>
