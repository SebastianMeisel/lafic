\title{Introduction to LaFiC}
\author{Sebastian Meisel}

\begin{document}

\maketitle


{LaFiC means \textit{layout and format in comments}, as all layout and
format information is put into comment lines. So layout and
content are \emph{fully} separated. For details see \nameref{Writing}\xspace .\\}

\section{Why LaFiC}

{I've been working with \LaTeX\  / \XeLaTeX\  for many years
now. Mostly I'm writing prose (no math at all). I often
found it disturbing, that I'm forced to create a preamble
instead of just start writing.\\}

{I started using markdown / multimarkdown. Being quite
inflexible it didn't convince me either. Also I didn't like
the cryptic syntax so much. The \LaTeX\  output was quite
cryptic as well.\\}

{The I remembered my father saying, he'd like to be able to
just start writing as with his old typewriter only with a
better formating to end with.\\}

{Last but not least I was thinking a lot about how the layout
and formation of a text could be cleaner separated from the
content.\\}

{With LaFiC I can start writing without a thought about the
Layout. Still I get a well structured HTML or (Xe)LaTeX\footnote{The standard templates for LaFiC are all based on \XeLaTeX\  to support UTF-8. Still using \LaTeX\  should be possible.}\xspace 
document, that I can further render to PDF.\\}

{When I'm ready with writing, I can start formatation by
adding human readable comments, beeing my own lector.\\}

\part{Installation and Usage}

\section{Prerequisites}

{LaFiC requires Perl > 5.10.1 (tested with Perl 5.26.1).\\}

{The standard templates require a resent \XeLaTeX\  installation
with a least graphicx, hyperref, microtype and xspace.\\}

{The Gnu Emacs lisp files where tested with Gnu Emacs 25.2.2.\\}

{\texttt{lafic2pdf} also requires latexmk (tested with version 4.41).\\}

\section{Installation}
\label{installation}

{Get source from \href{https://github.com}{github} using:\\}

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/SebastianMeisel/lafic.git
\end{verbatim}


{Add lafic directory to \$PATH, e.g.:\\}

\begin{verbatim}
export PATH=${PATH}:~/lafic
\end{verbatim}


{See \texttt{lafic-mode.el} for installation instructions, if you want
to use in in Gnu Emacs\footnote{GNU Emacs is available as free Software under a GNU General Public License for most modern operating systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, macOS und Windows).}\xspace .\\}

\section{Usage}

{For now the LaFiC distribution consists of three scripts
that you call with the name of the LaFiC file.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
# lafic2html Datei.lafic
# lafic2tex Datei.lafic
# lafic2pdf Datei.lafic
\end{verbatim}


{The last of these is a bash script, first calling \texttt{lafic2tex}
and then \texttt{latexmk}.\\}

{Calling these three script would result in the following
files:\\}

\begin{verbatim}
Datei.html
Datei.tex
Datei.pdf
\end{verbatim}


\section{LaFiC major mode in GNU Emacs}

{After installing and activation \texttt{lafic-mode.el} (see
\nameref{installation}\xspace ), the LaFiC major mode is activated on opening
any file with a \texttt{*.lafic} extension.\\}

{This gives you basic syntax highlighting and some keyboard
shortcuts with a \texttt{C-c} prefix. The shortcuts are similar to
those used in AUCTeX.\\}

\part{Writing text in LaFiC}
\label{Writing}

\section{Lines and paragraphs}

{The content is presented in two forms, which also include
the most basic layout: There are \emph{lines} and \emph{paragraphs}.\\}

{The difference is not so much the length, but lines include
none of the punctation marks \emph{(., ?, !, :)}. If no
further layout information is provided, these are
interpreted as headings.\\}

{The \emph{first} line is interpreted as the title and presented as
 <h1>, when converted to \textsc{Html}, and \textbackslash title, when 
converted to \LaTeX\ .\\}

{Further \emph{lines} will be converted to <h3> (\textsc{Html}) or \textbackslash section
(LaTeX), if no otherwise specified.\\}

{This way simple documents may be structured with no explicit
layout information at all.\\}

\section{Comments}

{You can add comments to your text, by starting a paragraph
with two \% chars with \textbf{no leading spaces}:\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  %% This is a comment.

  %% This is a longer comment, that spreads over several
  %% lines. It is important that it is not connected to a line
  %% of the general content.
\end{verbatim}


\section{Formated paragraphs}

{Paragraphs can be formated by adding a line before the
paragraph, that starts with a \% char, followed by a single
word. There are some predefined keywords, like quote or
quotation for – well a quotation.
If the keyword is unknown, it will be converted to an environment
name in \LaTeX\  or the name of a <div> in Html.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  % quote
  This is a quotation.
\end{verbatim}


\begin{quote}
This is a quotation.
\end{quote}


{Two paragraph starting with the same keyword will be
concatenated to one block / environment.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  % center
  This paragraph is centered

  % center
  This one, too.
\end{verbatim}


{Becomes:\\}

\begin{center}
This paragraph is centered

This one, too.
\end{center}


{The following keywords are available at the moment:\\}

\begin{itemize}
\item quote for quote environment / <blockquote>
\item quotation for quotation environment / <blockquote>
\item center for center environment / <div class=“center”>, with text-align=center
\end{itemize}


\section{Formated lines}

{Line are formated in the same way, only they are converted
to macros (LaTeX) oder <span> names (HTML). Know keywords
are:\\}

\begin{itemize}
\item title, h1 or heading1 for  title / <h1>
\item part, h2, heading or chapter\footnote{chapter is not available in standard template as it is not available in the document classed used.}\xspace  for part, chapter\footnote{chapter is not available in standard template as it is not available in the document classed used.}\xspace  / <h2>
\item section, h3 or heading3 for section / <h3>
\item subsection, h4 or heading4 for subsection / <h4>
\item subsubsection, h5 or heading5 for subsubsection / <h5>
\item paragraph, h6 or heading6 for paragraph / <h6>
\item h or heading for addsec
\item marginpar or annote for marginpar / <span class=“annote”>
\end{itemize}


\marginpar{This is a test.}

\begin{verbatim}
  % heading4
  This is a subsection
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{This is a subsection}

\section{Inline formation}

{If you want to format words or sequences in a paragraph (or
line if needed), you add format lines with a leading \% after
a paragraph. It has two parts:\\}

\begin{enumerate}
\item the word or the sequence to be formated in the form
  start…end. 
\item a keyword.
\end{enumerate}


{The both are separated by a »:«.\\}

{Known environment keywords are e.g. quote or quotation.\\}

{If the keyword is unknown, it is converted to a macro
(LaTeX) oder <span> (HTML) name.\\}

\section{Lists}

{Lists are the only things, that need some kind of
markup. You have to start each topic of the list with one of
the following chars: –, *, +, -. It doesn't matter, which one you
choose. You may indent the lines, but that has no influence
on the layout.\\}

\begin{verbatim}

* Top 1.
- Top 2.
\end{verbatim}


\begin{itemize}
\item Top 1.
\item Top 2.
\end{itemize}


{For multilevel lists, you have to choises, to raise or
decrease the level: The clean LaFiC style would be,
to start a new paragraph and add the keyword \texttt{»\% level+«}
or \texttt{»\% level-«} at the end.\\}

\begin{verbatim}

  * Top 1.
  * Top 2.


  * Top 2a.
  * Top 2b.
  % level+
\end{verbatim}


\begin{itemize}
\item Top 1.
\item Top 2.

\begin{itemize}
\item Top 2a.
\item Top 2b.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


{Or you can write the list in one paragraph, marking the
raise or decrease of the level with a > or < at the
beginning of a single line.\\}

\begin{verbatim}

  * Top 1.
  * Top 2.
  >
    * Top 2a.
    * Top 2b.
  <
  * Top 3
\end{verbatim}


\begin{itemize}
\item Top 1.
\item Top 2.
\begin{itemize}
\item Top 2a.
\item Top 2b.
\end{itemize}
\item Top 3
\end{itemize}


\section{Images}

{The simplest way to put an image into a LaFiC file is a
line with the image name, with a know extention: png, jpg,
jpeg, gif.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  Image.png
  % height = 40%
\end{verbatim}


{\includegraphics[height=.40\textheight]{Image.png}}

{Note that this will not put an figure environment in \LaTeX\ 
files, so the image won't float this way. For this to
achieve to have to put \% image, \%img or \%figure before the
line. You don't need the extention then.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  %image
  Image.png
  % width = 40%
  % caption = "Moon and Mars"
\end{verbatim}


\begin{figure}[hbt]
%%
\includegraphics[width=.40\linewidth]{Image.png}
\caption{"Moon and Mars"}
\end{figure}
\end{document}

%%% Local Variables:
%%% mode: latex
%%% TeX-master: t
%%% End:
