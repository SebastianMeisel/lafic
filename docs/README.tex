\title{Introduction to LaFiC}
\author{Sebastian Meisel}

\begin{document}

\maketitle


{LaFiC means \textit{layout and format in comments}, as all layout and
format information is put into comment lines. So layout and
content are \emph{fully} separated. For details see \nameref{Writing}\xspace .\\}

\section{Why LaFiC}

{I've been working with \LaTeX\  / \XeLaTeX\  for many years
now. Mostly I'm writing prose (no math at all). I often
found it disturbing, that I'm forced to create a preamble
instead of just start writing.\\}

{I started using markdown / multimarkdown. Being quite
inflexible it didn't convince me either. Also I didn't like
the cryptic syntax so much. The \LaTeX\  output was quite
cryptic as well.\\}

{The I remembered my father saying, he'd like to be able to
just start writing as with his old typewriter only with a
better formating to end with.\\}

{Last but not least I was thinking a lot about how the layout
and formation of a text could be cleaner separated from the
content.\\}

{With LaFiC I can start writing without a thought about the
Layout. Still I get a well structured HTML or (Xe)LaTeX\footnote{The standard templates for LaFiC are all based on \XeLaTeX\  to support UTF-8. Still using \LaTeX\  should be possible.}\xspace 
document, that I can further render to PDF.\\}

{When I'm ready with writing, I can start format by
adding human readable comments, beeing my own lector.\\}

\part{Installation and Usage}

\section{Prerequisites}

{LaFiC requires Perl > 5.10.1 (tested with Perl 5.26.1).\\}

{The standard templates require a resent \XeLaTeX\  installation
with a least graphicx, hyperref, microtype and xspace.\\}

{The Gnu Emacs lisp files where tested with Gnu Emacs 25.2.2.\\}

{\texttt{lafic2pdf} also requires latexmk (tested with version 4.41).\\}

\section{Installation}
\label{installation}

{Get source from \href{https://github.com}{github} using:\\}

\begin{verbatim}
git clone https://github.com/SebastianMeisel/lafic.git
\end{verbatim}


{Add lafic directory to \$PATH, e.g.:\\}

\begin{verbatim}
export PATH=${PATH}:~/lafic
\end{verbatim}


{See \texttt{lafic-mode.el} for installation instructions, if you want
to use in in Gnu Emacs\footnote{GNU Emacs is available as free Software under a GNU General Public License for most modern operating systems (Unix, GNU/Linux, macOS und Windows).}\xspace .\\}

\section{Usage}

{For now the LaFiC distribution consists of three scripts
that you call with the name of the LaFiC file.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
# lafic2html Datei.lafic
# lafic2tex Datei.lafic
# lafic2pdf Datei.lafic
\end{verbatim}


{The last of these is a bash script, first calling \texttt{lafic2tex}
and then \texttt{latexmk}.\\}

{Calling these three script would result in the following
files:\\}

\begin{verbatim}
Datei.html
Datei.tex
Datei.pdf
\end{verbatim}


\section{LaFiC major mode in GNU Emacs}

{After installing and activation \texttt{lafic-mode.el} (see
\nameref{installation}\xspace ), the LaFiC major mode is activated on opening
any file with a \texttt{*.lafic} extension.\\}

{This gives you basic syntax highlighting and some keyboard
shortcuts with a \texttt{C-c} prefix. The shortcuts are similar to
those used in AUCTeX.\\}

\part{Writing text in LaFiC}
\label{Writing}

\section{Lines and paragraphs}

{The content is presented in two forms, which also include
the most basic layout: There are \emph{lines} and \emph{paragraphs}.\\}

{The difference is not so much the length, but lines include
none of the punctation marks \emph{(., ?, !, :)}. If no
further layout information is provided, these are
interpreted as headings.\\}

{The \emph{first} line is interpreted as the title and presented as
 <h1>, when converted to \textsc{Html}, and \textbackslash title, when 
converted to \LaTeX\ .\\}

{Further \emph{lines} will be converted to <h3> (\textsc{Html}) or \textbackslash section
(LaTeX), if no otherwise specified.\\}

{This way simple documents may be structured with no explicit
layout information at all.\\}

\section{Comments}

{You can add comments to your text, by starting a paragraph
with two \% chars with \textbf{no leading spaces}:\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  %% This is a comment.

  %% This is a longer comment, that spreads over several
  %% lines. It is important that it is not connected to a line
  %% of the general content.
\end{verbatim}


\section{Formated paragraphs}

{Paragraphs can be formated by adding a line before the
paragraph, that starts with a \% char, followed by a single
word. There are some predefined keywords, like quote or
quotation for – well a quotation.
If the keyword is unknown, it will be converted to an environment
name in \LaTeX\  or the name of a <div> in Html.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  % quote
  This is a quotation.
\end{verbatim}


\begin{quote}
This is a quotation.
\end{quote}


{Two paragraph starting with the same keyword will be
concatenated to one block / environment.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  % center
  This paragraph is centered

  % center
  This one, too.
\end{verbatim}


{Becomes:\\}

\begin{center}
This paragraph is centered

This one, too.
\end{center}


{The following keywords are available at the moment:\\}

\begin{itemize}
\item quote for quote environment / <blockquote>
\item quotation for quotation environment / <blockquote>
\item center for center environment / <div class=“center”>, with text-align=center
\end{itemize}


\section{Formated lines}
\label{form_lines}

{Line are formated in the same way, only they are converted
to macros (LaTeX) oder <span> names (HTML). Know keywords
are:\\}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{“title”}, “h1” or \texttt{“heading1”} for \textbackslash title / <h1>
\item \texttt{“part”}, “h2”, \texttt{“heading”} or \texttt{“chapter”}\footnote{Chapter is not available in standard template as it is not available in the document class used.}\xspace  for \textbackslash part, \textbackslash chapter / <h2>
\item \texttt{“section”}, “h3” or \texttt{“heading3”} for \textbackslash section / <h3>
\item \texttt{“subsection”}, “h4” or \texttt{“heading4”} for \textbackslash subsection / <h4>
\item \texttt{“subsubsection”}, “h5” or \texttt{“heading5”} for \textbackslash subsubsection / <h5>
\item \texttt{“paragraph”}, “h6” or \texttt{“heading6”} for \textbackslash paragraph / <h6>
\item \texttt{“h”} or \texttt{“heading”} for \textbackslash addsec
\item \texttt{“marginpar”} or \texttt{“annote”} for \textbackslash marginpar / <span class=\texttt{“annote”}>
\end{itemize}


\begin{verbatim}
  % heading4
  This is a subsection
\end{verbatim}


\subsection{This is a subsection}

\section{Inline formation}

{If you want to format words or sequences in a paragraph (or
line if needed), you add format lines with a leading \% after
a paragraph. It has two parts:\\}

\begin{enumerate}
\item the word or the sequence to be formated in the form
  start…end. 
\item a keyword.
\end{enumerate}


{The both are separated by a colon.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  Hallo dear old world!
  % Hallo: bold
  % ol…ld: emphasize
\end{verbatim}


{Becomes:
\textbf{Hallo} dear \emph{old world}!\\}

{Known format keywords are:\\}

\begin{itemize}
\item \texttt{“bold”} for \textbackslash textbf / <b>
\item \texttt{“emphasize”} for \textbackslash emph / <em>
\item \texttt{“italic”} for \textbackslash textit / <i>
\item \texttt{“mono”} or \texttt{“typewriter”} for \textbackslash texttt / <span class=\texttt{“tt”}>
\item “smallcaps” for \textbackslash textsc / <span class=\texttt{“sc”}>
\item “superscript” for \textbackslash textsuperscript / <sup>
\item \texttt{“subscript”} for \textbackslash textsubscript / <sub>
\end{itemize}


{If the keyword is unknown, it is converted to a macro
(LaTeX) oder <span> (HTML) name.\\}

{Some keywords need a second argument which is added
after a second colon:\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  This is a green world!
  % green: color: red
\end{verbatim}


{becomes:
This is a \textcolor{red}{green} world!\\}

{Know keywords of that kind are:\\}

\begin{itemize}
\item “url” or “link” for \textbackslash href / <a href=‘ {[url]}’>
\item “see” for \textbackslash nameref / <a href='\#{[label]}’> 
\item “footnote”\footnote{In HTML documents footnote are presented in an <ol> list that is placed in a <div id=“footnotes”> container at the end of the document. Each footnote is placed in a <li id=“fnx”> element.}\xspace  for \textbackslash footnote / <a class=‘ fn’ href=‘ xfn{[x]}’>
\item “color” for \textbackslash textcolor / <span style=‘ color: {[color]}’>
\end{itemize}


\section{Parameters}

{It is also possible to add some additional parameters to the whole
paragraph or line. This is done quite similar to the inline
formats, but with a equal sign separating the keyword from
the value:\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  This text is white on blue and aligned to the right.
  % background = blue
  % color = white
  % align = right
\end{verbatim}


{becomes:\\}

\colorbox{PaleTurquoise1}{\parbox{\linewidth}{%%
{\raggedleft%%
\textcolor{red}{%%
This paragraph has a red on blue text and is aligned to the
right.}\\}
}
}

{Known parameters are:\\}

\begin{itemize}
\item “name” or “label” for \textbackslash label / <?? id=“{[id]}”> that is
  referred to by the “see” keyword.
\item “background” for \textbackslash colorbox / <div style=‘ background: {[color]}’>.
\item “color” for \textbackslash textcolor / <div style=‘ color: {[color]}’>.
\item “align” for \textbackslash raggedleft, \textbackslash centering or \textbackslash raggedright / <div
  style=‘ text-align: {[align]}’>.
\end{itemize}


\section{Lists}

{Lists are the only things, that need some kind of
markup. You have to start each topic of the list with one of
the following chars: –, *, +, -. It doesn't matter, which one you
choose. You may indent the lines, but that has no influence
on the layout.\\}

\begin{verbatim}

* Top 1.
- Top 2.
\end{verbatim}


\begin{itemize}
\item Top 1.
\item Top 2.
\end{itemize}


{For multilevel lists, you have to choises, to raise or
decrease the level: The clean LaFiC style would be,
to start a new paragraph and add the keyword \texttt{»\% level+«}
or \texttt{»\% level-«} at the end.\\}

\begin{verbatim}

  * Top 1.
  * Top 2.


  * Top 2a.
  * Top 2b.
  % level+
\end{verbatim}


\begin{itemize}
\item Top 1.
\item Top 2.

\begin{itemize}
\item Top 2a.
\item Top 2b.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}


{Or you can write the list in one paragraph, marking the
raise or decrease of the level with a > or < at the
beginning of a single line.\\}

\begin{verbatim}

  * Top 1.
  * Top 2.
  >
    * Top 2a.
    * Top 2b.
  <
  * Top 3
\end{verbatim}


\begin{itemize}
\item Top 1.
\item Top 2.
\begin{itemize}
\item Top 2a.
\item Top 2b.
\end{itemize}
\item Top 3
\end{itemize}


\section{Images}

{The simplest way to put an image into a LaFiC file is a
line with the image name, with a know extention: png, jpg,
jpeg, gif.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  Image.png
  % height = 40%
\end{verbatim}


{\includegraphics[height=.40\textheight]{Image.png}}

{Note that this will not put an figure environment in \LaTeX\ 
files, so the image won't float this way. For this to
achieve to have to put \% image, \%img or \%figure before the
line. You don't need the extention then.\\}

\begin{verbatim}
  %image
  Image.png
  % width = 40%
  % caption = "Moon and Mars"
\end{verbatim}


\begin{figure}[hbt]
%%
\includegraphics[width=.40\linewidth]{Image.png}
\caption{"Moon and Mars"}
\end{figure}
\end{document}

%%% Local Variables:
%%% mode: latex
%%% TeX-master: t
%%% End:
